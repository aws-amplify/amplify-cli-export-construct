...
const amplifyExport = new AmplifyExportBackend(app, 'AmplifyExportedBackend', {
  path: './amplify-export-myAmplifyApp',
  stage: 'dev', 
});


```



#### Construct Props

The construct props extend [stack props](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/cdk/api/latest/docs/@aws-cdk_core.StackProps.html) and can be used to override the root stack properties.

|Name	|Type	|Description	|Required	|Default	|
|---	|---	|---	|---	|---	|
|path	|String	|You can use the absolute or the relative path to the location of the folder. When using relative paths it's important to note that the path is relative to the root of your CDK application	|Yes	|undefined	|
|stage	|String	|This works similar to Amplify CLI's environment names. The construct makes modification to be able to integrate into the CDK app.	|No	|dev	|
