## Amplify CLI cdk-exported-backend


[![Integration Tests](https://github.com/aws-amplify/amplify-cli-export-construct/actions/workflows/integration-test.yml/badge.svg?branch=main)](https://github.com/aws-amplify/amplify-cli-export-construct/actions/workflows/integration-test.yml)


This CDK construct is used to include the CloudFormation resources generated by [Amplify CLI Export command](https://docs.amplify.aws/cli/usage/export-to-cdk/). The construct handles assets and CloudFormation files. It offers abstractions over the Amplify CLI generated cloud resources.

The library is published under the following

|Language	|Repository	|
|---	|---	|
|Typescript/Javascript	| [@aws-amplify/cdk-exported-backend](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@aws-amplify/cdk-exported-backend)	|
|Python	| [aws-amplify.cdk.exported-backend](https://pypi.org/project/aws-amplify.cdk.exported-backend/)	|
|Java	| [com.amplifyframework:exported-backend](https://search.maven.org/artifact/com.amplifyframework/exported-backend)	|

### Usage

Install via NPM:


```bash
npm i @aws-amplify/cdk-exported-backend@latest
```


Add to your CDK app:


```js
import { AmplifyExportedBackend }  from '@aws-amplify/cdk-exported-backend';
...
const amplifyExport = new AmplifyExportedBackend(app, 'AmplifyExportedBackend', {
  path: './amplify-export-myAmplifyApp'
});


```



#### Construct Props

The construct props extend [stack props](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/cdk/api/latest/docs/@aws-cdk_core.StackProps.html) and can be used to override the root stack properties.

| Name	              | Type   | Description                                                                                                                                                                                  | Required | Default   |
|--------------------|--------|----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|----------|-----------|
| path               | String | You can use the absolute or the relative path to the location of the folder. When using relative paths it's important to note that the path is relative to the root of your CDK application. | Yes      | undefined |
| amplifyEnvironment | String | The construct emulates Amplify CLI's environment name convention to integrate Amplify exported resources into the CDK app.                                                                   | No       | dev       |
| amplifyAppId       | String | Create an Amplify backend environment for the specified Amplify App Id. Do not provide an amplifyAppId if the environment was already added by the Amplify CLI.                              | No       | undefined |
